-First I ran the file because it was executable and it was asking for a password.
-I then decompiled the code and tried my luck with chatgpt then it gave me a password.
-When I used the password, I got a string with random variables.

-I opened the url and found billy butcher's infamous "Don't be a cunt" pic, I used the inspect tab and found the flag.
