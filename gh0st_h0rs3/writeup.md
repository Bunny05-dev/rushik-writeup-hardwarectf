-This particular question was a bit tricky. I asked for help from Arjun bhaiyya and understood that CAN is a network primarily used for communications in vehicles.
-Bhaiyya suggested looking up a github page which contained information on how to proceed.

-After filtering, I tried hex and I got the flag
